Animation Using Manim
This repository will contain code examples and projects demonstrating the creation of mathematical animations using the Manim library. Manim, short for "Mathematical Animation Engine," is a powerful Python library developed by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) for programmatically creating precise animations, primarily for educational videos.

Project Description
This project aims to explore various animation techniques and concepts using Manim. It will serve as a personal playground for learning Manim, creating visual explanations of mathematical concepts, and potentially generating engaging video content.

Features
Manim offers a wide range of functionalities, and this project will likely showcase:

Creating Mobjects: Representing mathematical objects like points, lines, circles, polygons, text, and equations.

Transformations: Animating objects changing their position, rotation, scale, color, and more.

Scene Management: Structuring animations into logical scenes and managing their flow.

Equations: Rendering beautiful LaTeX equations.

Graphs and Plots: Visualizing data and functions.

Custom Animations: Developing unique animation sequences.

Integration with Video: Generating high-quality video files from scripts.
